}
\value{
A data frame with 500 observations and 12 variables:
\describe{
\item{Age}{Numeric variable with normal distribution}
\item{Income}{Numeric variable with log-normal distribution and some outliers}
\item{Height}{Numeric variable in centimeters}
\item{Weight}{Numeric variable in kilograms with some outliers}
\item{BMI}{Numeric variable calculated from height and weight}
\item{BloodPressure}{Numeric variable}
\item{Gender}{Categorical variable with three levels: "Male", "Female", "Non-binary"}
\item{Education}{Categorical variable with four levels: "High School", "Bachelor's", "Master's", "PhD"}
\item{Region}{Categorical variable with five levels: "North", "South", "East", "West", "Central"}

}
\description{
This function loads a demo dataset included with the EDAhelper package.
The dataset contains various variable types (numeric, categorical, date)
with some missing values and outliers, making it suitable for demonstrating
EDA techniques.
}
\note{
The dataset has intentionally included missing values (approximately 10\%)
and outliers to demonstrate various EDA techniques.
